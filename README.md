📘 AI Course Generator

This is an ongoing project scheduled for completion by the end of February.

The core idea behind this project is an AI-powered course generator designed to solve a common problem faced by students: finding the right learning resources in one place. Many learners struggle to discover a single course that fully matches their needs. As a result, they often jump between multiple YouTube one-shots, tutorials, and scattered materials, wasting time searching instead of learning.

This project aims to eliminate that inefficiency.

The AI Course Generator intelligently gathers and organizes study material from multiple platforms and delivers a personalized, structured learning path tailored to each student’s goals. Instead of spending hours searching for the right content, students receive a curated course that is efficient, relevant, and focused.

✨ Key Goals

Reduce time wasted searching for tutorials

Provide a single, optimized learning roadmap

Personalize content based on student needs

This project is built with the vision of making learning simpler, faster, and more targeted.
